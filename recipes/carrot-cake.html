    <p>The ultimate moist and delicious carrot cake.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li> 
       <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>   
       <li>3 cups lightly packed shredded carrots (I used about 4 large ones)</li>
       <li>1 1/2 cup canned juice-packed crushed pineapple, drained</li>
       <li>1 cup coarsely chopped toasted walnuts</li>
       <li>1 cup sweetened shredded coconut</li>
       <li>6 eggs</li>
       <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
       <li>2 cups vegetable oil</li>
       <li>1 batch of your favourite cream cheese frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans. Line the bottom with rounds of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. Toss the raisins with the remaining tablespoon of flour. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, toss together the shredded carrots, pineapple, toasted walnuts and coconut.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer with the paddle, beat together the eggs and sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes, or until light and thick. Add the vanilla and oil and beat well. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>On low speed, gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until just barely incorporated. Remove the bowl and scrape down the bottom and sides. Use a spatula to fold and mix the batter until no streaks of flour remain.</li>
        <li>Fold in the carrot mixture.</li>
        <li>Evenly divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cakes cool. Transfer them to a cooling pan and apply frosting evenly.</li>
    </ol>
